# Dishi - Product Vision

## Overview

**Dishi** is a hyperlocal food discovery platform connecting neighborhood kitchens with nearby customers. Think "Jiji Kenya, but for food" — a searchable directory of local home cooks, small restaurants, and mom-and-pop food businesses that currently rely on WhatsApp and word-of-mouth.

---

## The Problem

Thousands of small food businesses operate successfully in Kenyan neighborhoods, but they're invisible to anyone outside their immediate social circle:

- **Kitchens** broadcast menus via WhatsApp status updates and physical flyers
- **Customers** discover them only through word-of-mouth or chance encounters
- **No centralized place** to find "what's cooking near me right now"
- **No way to browse** options, compare menus, or discover new spots

These aren't failing businesses — they have loyal customers and great food. They just lack visibility beyond their existing network.

---

## The Vision

**Dishi makes neighborhood kitchens discoverable.**

We're not replacing WhatsApp or disrupting how these businesses operate. We're creating a front door — a place where hungry customers can browse what's available nearby and connect directly with kitchens.

### Core Principles

1. **Discovery-first** — Phase 1 is purely about browsing and finding. No payments, no complex order management. Just "what's cooking near me?"

2. **Hyperlocal by design** — The unit is the neighborhood, not the city. A 10-minute bike ride radius. These are kitchens run by people you might actually know.

3. **Preserve existing workflows** — Kitchens already have their WhatsApp and M-Pesa flows. We don't replace them; we drive traffic to them.

4. **Community over commerce** — This isn't Uber Eats. It's your neighbor's kitchen. The vibe is mom-and-pop, local, personal.

5. **Mobile-first, data-light** — Built for Android users with varying connectivity. Fast, light, works on 3G.

## Target Users

### Kitchen Owners (Supply Side)

- Home cooks selling meals to neighbors
- Small restaurants without online presence
- Catering services operating via WhatsApp
- Food vendors with loyal but limited customer base

**What they want:** More customers finding them, without changing how they operate.

### Hungry Customers (Demand Side)

- Neighborhood residents looking for affordable, homemade food
- People tired of expensive delivery apps
- Those who prefer supporting local over chains
- Anyone asking "what can I eat nearby right now?"

**What they want:** Easy way to discover local food options and connect with kitchens.

## Phase 1: Discovery Platform (MVP)

### Kitchen Owner Experience

- **Simple profile creation** — Name, location, photo, contact (WhatsApp number)
- **Menu posting** — Add dishes with photos, descriptions, prices
- **Availability toggle** — "Open today" / "Closed today"
- **Daily specials** — Highlight what's cooking today (many kitchens rotate menus)

### Customer Experience

- **Location-based feed** — See kitchens near you
- **Browse menus** — View what each kitchen offers
- **Filter & search** — By cuisine type, "open now", distance
- **Direct contact** — Tap to WhatsApp the kitchen directly
- **Save favorites** — Follow kitchens you like

### What Phase 1 Does NOT Include

- Payment processing (kitchens handle their own M-Pesa)
- In-app ordering or checkout
- Delivery coordination
- Ratings and reviews (consider for Phase 1.5)
- Order history or tracking

- **Word of mouth** — If the product is good, kitchens will tell other kitchens
